#stats uploading (experimental)
#-----------------------
#ok so not all of you have bitchbot running on a computer with a web server
#and you want to upload your channel stats to your ISP's webspace or whatever.
#well now you can (EXPERIMENTAL) with Net::FTP. You must have this perl module
#installed or the bot will die on you as it tries to upload the stats. If in
#doubt do the standard perl -MCPAN -e shell; followed by install Net::FTP.
#or ask your system administrator if you don't have r00t. Windows users, you'll
#probably want to grab the precompiled version from the bitchbot website.
#----------------------
#be aware though, if you are on a slow link the time it takes the bot to generate
#the stats AND upload them might cause it to time out. your call. on windows this
#is a particularly nasty problem since the bot can't tell when stats are finished
#and ends up locking up until they are finished. if you then have to wait for them
#to be uploaded as well you do risk having the bot time out (but with an auto restart
#script it should come right back).
#-----------------------
#note when i say 'experimental' i mean I've tested it locally over my LAN under
#various situations and it works fine - the problem is I don't have net access
#as I'm coding this, so I can't do a "real" test. but it's quite likely to work.
